#Threadmill

This is an Rails App to fulfil Rob Hudson's [coding challenge](https://gist.github.com/robbiehudson/a1c2daf2b836d4657cd5). It's built with Rails 4.2.2.

To get started, run `bundle install` and `rake db:setup`, then `bundle install rspec` to verify tests, and finally `rails s`, before navigating to localhost:3000 in the browser.
